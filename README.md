# bayesian_travails
Used to publish stuff while I wrap my head around Bayesian inference. Don't trust anything in here!

## Rules of this repo

Anything goes, but:

* No real data points, only simulated (or generated from a deterministic source)
* No corporate or academic secrets whatsoever - so don't go looking for data expecting to find anything "of value"
* No guarantees that anything makes sense. Code might be wrong, as is often the case when learning.

Feedback appreciated - that's the only way to learn!
